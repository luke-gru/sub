sub v0.1.2
Usage: sub COMMANDLINE -- (PATTERN/SUBSTITUTION[/SUB_FLAGS])+ (/GLOBAL_FLAGS)?

sub substitutes the matching pattern in every word in the command line with the
substitution. Only the first matched pattern in the word is substituted unless
the 'g' flag is given. There are various options that change the way substitutions
are performed or the way matches are made. Patterns can have regular expression
wildcards (special characters) in them, and the regular expression engine used is
Ruby's. Special characters are interpreted as special unless the 'L' flag is given.

See [https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Special+Characters]
for more information on the special characters that can be used inside patterns.

The sub utility is useful mainly when editing long commandlines, so you don't have to
<ctrl-b> and <ctrl-f> (or <left> and <right>) through the commandline to edit it. The
examples given here don't feature long commandlines for the sake of being brief and
explanatory.

Ex: sub ld -m elf_i386 ex4.o -o ex4 -- ex4/ex5
    This will output the following, and then execute it:
    ld -m elf_i386 ex5.o -o ex5

Multiple substitutions:

  Multiple substitutions can be given as well, such as:

  Ex: sub ld -m elf_i386 ex4.o -o ex4 -- ex4/ex5 i386/arm64
      ld -m elf_arm64 ex5.o -o ex5

  If multiple substitutions are given, each subsitution pattern is matched with
  each word, then the next substitution pattern does the same.

Global flags:
  Global flags can be given as the last argument:

  ex: sub find . | grep '.txt' -- txt/md /p
  In this example, the print flag is given as a final argument.
  See flags information below.

Flags:

Substitution flags:
-f:	Substitute first matching word only.
  	  ex: sub wget https://wget.com -- wget/curl/f #=> curl https://wget.com
-l:	Substitute last matching word only
  	  ex: sub ls -al -- l//l #=> ls -a
-L:	Interpret wildcards in pattern as literals
  	  ex: sub cp here.txt there.txt -- ./_/L #=> cp here_txt there_txt
-i:	Set pattern to ignore the case of the match
  	  ex: sub cp here.txt there.txt -- CP/mv/i #=> mv here.txt there.txt
-g:	General substitution: substitute all matches in the word, not just the first
  	  ex: sub cp here.txt there.txt -- ./_/g #=> __ ________ _________
-e:	Expand * in commandline after replacements are made
  	  ex: sub ls mydir -- mydir/*/e #=> ls bin README
Global flags:
-p:	Print the command instead of executing it (adds newline)
-P:	Print the command instead of executing it (doesn't add newline)
-c:	Copy the command to clipboard instead of executing it
-I:	Set interactive mode: shows the command and asks if you want to execute it
-v:	Set verbose mode
-D:	Set debug mode
Other flags:
-h,--help:	Show help (-h shows short help, --help shows full)
-v,--version:	Show version followed by a newline
