Sub
===

Description:

It substitutes a command-line with a new commandline by replacing a pattern with another pattern.
This makes it easy to edit the previous command by doing:
<CTRL-p>
<CTRL-a>sub <CTRL-e> -- pat/pat

instead of trying to edit the middle of a long commandline.

Usage:

sub COMMANDLINE -- PATTERN

$ sub ld -m elf_i386 ex4.o -o ex4 -- ex4/ex5

This substitutes ex4 with ex5. It will print:

  Executing ld -m elf_i386 ex5.o -o ex5

and it will run it.

To just do a dry run (don't execute the command), it's:

$ sub ld -m elf_i386 ex4.o -o ex4 -- ex4/ex5/d

This will just print the command out.

To just replace the first found value (f flag for first) or last 
found value (l flag for last):

$ sub ls -al * -- l//l

  Executing ls -ad
